     * thread a means to free any such threads in cases where the

     * The `setNetworkTimeout` method will cover cases where
     * there is no administrator thread, or it has no access to the
     * connection. This method is severe in it's effects, and should be
     * given a high enough value so it is never triggered before any more
     * normal timeouts, such as transaction timeouts.
     *
     *
     * JDBC driver implementations  may also choose to support the
     * `setNetworkTimeout` method to impose a limit on database
     * response time, in environments where no network is present.
     *
     *
     * Drivers may internally implement some or all of their API calls with
     * multiple internal driver-database transmissions, and it is left to the
     * driver implementation to determine whether the limit will be
     * applied always to the response to the API call, or to any
     * single  request made during the API call.
     *
     *
     *
     * This method can be invoked more than once, such as to set a limit for an
     * area of JDBC code, and to reset to the default on exit from this area.
     * Invocation of this method has no impact on already outstanding
     * requests.
     *
     *
     * The `Statement.setQueryTimeout()` timeout value is independent of the
     * timeout value specified in `setNetworkTimeout`. If the query timeout
     * expires  before the network timeout then the
     * statement execution will be canceled. If the network is still
     * active the result will be that both the statement and connection
     * are still usable. However if the network timeout expires before
     * the query timeout or if the statement timeout fails due to network
     * problems, the connection will be marked as closed, any resources held by
     * the connection will be released and both the connection and
     * statement will be unusable.
     *
